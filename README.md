# Regression-Analysis-in-R
## This repository contains basics strategies, codes, and scripts of regression analysis learnt in the class Statistics 501 by Prof. Lynn Lin at Penn State. It focused on tools and techniques for performing regression analysis in R.

## Chapter 1. Introduction
### This chapter included introduction to RStudio (IDE), R basics, vectors, matrices, data structures,conditional statements, loop statements, function. 

## Chapter 2. Statistical Data Analysis 
### This chapter included basics of plotting graphs in R, altering the size of plot margins, plotting character, color, type, labels on axis, title fot the graph, hostograms, scatter plots, boxplot, and quantile functions.  

## Chapter 3. Simple Regression Analysis
### This chapter introduced concept of simple regression analysis and its uses. Regression analysis is the most widely used statistical tool for understanding relationships among variables. Prediction and forecasting can be performed using regression analysis. 
### Regression models conditional distribution of Y given X=x, i.e., P(Y=y|X=x). Given a specific value of X (i.e., X=x), we can predict the value of Y. Simple linear regression models relationship between two variables, X as explanatory variable (or Predictor) and Y as response (or Dependent) variable. Linear relationships  are easy to work with and are a good approximation in lots of real word problems.

## Chapter 4. Diagnostics and Transformations for Simple Linear Regressions
### This chapter introduces the analysis of regression models for accuracy and shortcomings. Regression functional form can be invalid if some explanatory variables are missing, presence of non-linear terms and outliers, faulty residual assumptions, etc.

### This chapter includes:
#### a. Residual plots
#### b. Leverage Points
#### c. Outliers
#### d.
